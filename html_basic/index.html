    <p><h1>This website highlights my journey through the ALX Software Engineering Program, a rigorous and immersive experience designed to develop world-class tech talent. Throughout this program, I’ve gained hands-on experience with real-world projects, covering foundational and advanced topics such as C programming, Linux systems, Python, web development, and more. Each challenge has pushed me to think critically, code efficiently, and grow both as a developer and a problem-solver.</h1></p>
    <p><h2>During my time at ALX, I've built a solid foundation in both front-end and back-end development. I've worked extensively with tools and languages such as Git, GitHub, Bash, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and C. I've also become proficient in collaborative development through pair programming, peer code reviews, and agile methodologies skills essential for success in the tech industry</h2></p>
    <p><h3>One of the most exciting aspects of this program has been the opportunity to build real projects from the ground up. From creating simple shell interpreters and memory allocators to developing full-stack applications and APIs, each project has allowed me to apply what I’ve learned in meaningful ways. These projects are not only proof of my technical growth, but also reflect my commitment to continuous learning and improvement.</h3></p>
